## Summary

BudgetBuddy is a command-line app that I use to keep track of my spending habits and income. It was borne out of a frustration with personal finance apps like Mint or RocketMoney. After a month or two of trying and failing to find an app with all of the features I wanted, I decided to make one myself.

BudgetBuddy is somewhat customized to my specific use cases and was not originally intended to be publicly useful. For that reason, there's not much in the way of documentation, although I'd be happy to answer questions. Some pieces of the package would be unnecessary for most people, but the base code could be useful to someone else.

BudgetBuddy currently has some sections that are messy due to accumulated patches. I mean to clean them up eventually when I have a bit of time. :)
