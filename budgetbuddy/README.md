## Summary

BudgetBuddy is a command-line app that I use to keep track of my spending habits and income. It was borne out of a frustration with personal finance apps like Mint or RocketMoney. After a month or two of trying and failing to find an app with all of the features I wanted, I got fed up and decided to make one myself. In the process of making it, I became a much better Python programmer, which is nice.

BudgetBuddy is somewhat customized to my specific use cases and was not originally intended to be publicly useful. For that reason, I haven't made much in the way of documentation, although I'd be happy to answer questions. There are bits and pieces of the package that would be unnecessary for most people, but the base code could be useful to someone else.

BudgetBuddy is an ongoing project (see To Do section below) and has some sections that are messy due to accumulated patches. I mean to clean them up eventually when I have a bit of time. Don't judge too harshly, please!
